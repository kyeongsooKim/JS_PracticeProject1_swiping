Ths is my customized code for building swiping function for mobile app.
I didn't use any external library(Jquery, hammerJS, etc..), only using javascript code.
the page will get the touches event and calculate the speed of swiping and distance moved while touching the screen, deciding whether move the page or not.

There are 5pages in this example. but you can add more pages and customize it.
please testing this with Chrome using device inspection tool. start with index.html
